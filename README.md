About me : I always friendly , hard work and disciplined
I am studying at University of Information Technology and focus on Computer Science. 
This is my first year at University. Despite little experience, I will try my best to learn the new things and improve myself.
Although my English is not good, I want to practice it more because I have difficulty in speaking with foreigner.
Writing code and finding math solution are my hobbies, it doesn't excellent but still good.
